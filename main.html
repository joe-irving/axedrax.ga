<h2>What is Drax?</h2>
<p>
  Drax is the UK's single largest carbon emitter,
  and <a href="https://www.biofuelwatch.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/drax-briefing-update-2020_compressed.pdf">emitted almost 13 million tonnes of CO2 from burning wood in 2019</a>.&nbsp;
  Due to <a href="https://www.emissions-euets.com/carbon-market-glossary/976-biomass">EU</a>
  and
  <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/environment/uk-drax-power-plant-burning-us-trees-wood-pellets-deforestation-540122"> UK laws</a>
  that biomass is to be classed as "renewable", Drax received
  &pound;789.5 million in subsidy in 2019. However, it will take
  decades or even longer for new trees to be able to absorb the
  emissions produced by burning trees in Drax today. This is
  simply time we do not have if we are to keep global temperature
  rises below 1.5 degrees.
</p>
<p>
  In 2018, the government effectively ruled out future subsidies
  for large-scale biomass by changing the criteria for efficiency
  and greenhouse gas emissions for new biomass power stations. If
  even the government admits that power stations like Drax are not
  a solution, why does Drax still get to boast green credentials?
</p>
<p>
  Drax also makes bold claims about being the first carbon negative
  power station through its pilot project to capture carbon emissions
  from its tree burning. Yet,
  <a href="https://www.desmog.co.uk/2019/07/17/comment-policymakers-shouldn-t-trust-drax-s-bizarre-tree-burning-climate-solution">this bioenergy with carbon capture and storage technology is unproven</a>
  and even if it did work, it would lead to more forest destruction
  and increased carbon emissions.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If we can effectively transfer renewable subsidies from biomass
  burning to genuine renewables, then this can set a clean-energy
  precedent for other countries around the world. We must get the
  message out that
  <a href="https://physicsworld.com/a/biomass-energy-green-or-dirty/">large-scale tree burning is not a solution</a>
  (also see <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/dont-burn-trees-to-fight-climate-changelet-them-grow">here</a>).

<p>We must Axe Drax before it is too late.</p>
